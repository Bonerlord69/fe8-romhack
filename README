This is the head repository, hosted by Goetia.
We will include all of our screenshots, story scripts, sprites, maps, and patch documentation here.

Please be diligent in your documentation! ROMhacking is a precise task, and small changes can affect things you wouldn't expect.
If you have questions about the hack, be sure to ask @DuffleBag.
If you have suggestions for the hack, send them to one of the #Coders to see if it's possible and/or reasonable.
